For classics. Implements a painting canvas working with the database of elixir phoenix with some realtime things but not perfect 

Does not run out of box. Deleted pointless folders


http://localhost:4001/paintings

Was deployed to https://www.gigalixir.com/
Had to futz with things to get it to work

When you get to versions of things being not supported
Simply copying the next higher version to 
/elixir_buildpack.config
elixir_version=1.14
erlang_version=24.3.4

made it work!!!
